# Karma Grid System

## Abstract

Heavily inspired by [semantic.gs](http://semantic.gs/), and [the Goldilocks Approach](http://goldilocksapproach.com/). Be sure to check them out if you haven't before. Karma.gs is a grid system developed in a night of despair and inspiration. Essentially I restarted one of my core projects and realized that Bootstrap was becoming a bit of a clich√©. So I searched the internet for a different frontend framework. Came accross goldilocks - loved it. Came accross semantic.gs - loved it. So I guess this is really just a cocktail of these two frameworks/approaches with a dash of my personality.
